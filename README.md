# TodoListV2
A much better way to make a to-do list

I created this project for several reasons, but the main ones are:

1 - I'm training JS and React to create web applications and software
2 - I'm passionate about the Saas world, so I want to learn how to create one.

What have I learned from this?

1 - How to create functions that can: create, delete and prioritize tasks
2 - Using localStorage to save the tasks created on my machine
3 - New React and JavaScript concepts and best practices
4 - Improve my notion of code structure and code refactoring

What do I expect from the next project?

1 - To further improve my ability to think and create new functionalities for applications
2 - Improve code structuring and understanding
3 - To be able to code more on my own, without help from others

NOTE: This project was part of a mentoring program, so it is not entirely authorial.
